<h2>Sorting algorythms explained to myself</h2>

***

<h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
Checks the first two numbers. Swaps them if the first one is bigger. Leaves be if else.\
After that\
Checks second and third numbers. Swaps them if the second one is bigger. Leaves be if else.\
And so on...

<h1>Insertion Sort</h1>
Checks value of first number.\
Checks value of second number. Compares to to previous number . If smaller, place before compared number.\
Checks value of third number. Compares to to previous number . If bigger, place before compared number.\
If not bigger check\

(This ain't right. I don't know how sorting algorithms work, beside bubble sort)
